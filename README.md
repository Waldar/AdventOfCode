This is my take on Adventofcode 2024 - using whenever possible Databricks SQL.
Note currently the platform has no recursivity - so most solution may seems over-complicated and some of them while technicaly correct doesn't compute on the puzzle data input.

I'm also building solutions in DuckDB whenever recursivity seems inevitable.
