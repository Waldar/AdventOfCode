This is my take on [Adventofcode 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) - using whenever possible Databricks SQL.<br>
Note currently the platform has no recursivity - so most solution may seems over-complicated and some of them while technicaly correct doesn't compute on the puzzle data input.<br>

I'm only pushing here the 100% Databricks SQL solutions, but the missing days are done with DuckDB.
